# How often should crouke daemon request for updating the local content.
# Default is 1800 seconds.
FEED_UPDATE = 1800

# How often should crouke notify you when new update available.
# Default is 1800 seconds. This value normally at least equal to the FEED_UPDATE
# value. Since within the specified update interval, there will be no updates.
#
# Several examples:
#
# Feed updates every 10 mins and you get notified every 30 mins, which means
# you will see aggregated update info everytime.
# FEED_UPDATE = 600
# NOTIFY = 1800
#
# Feed updates every 30 mins and you get notified every 30 mins, which means
# you see exact what's new everytime, no more no less.
# FEED_UPDATE = 1800
# NOTIFY = 1800
#
NOTIFY = 30

# Websites that crouke will retrieve updates from. The site MUST provide a
# RESTful API for crouke to retrieve feeds. API CRUD standard doc can be found at
# http://api.gnome-look.org/
# As long as a website provides these standard CRUD actions, you can add it
# to this list.
