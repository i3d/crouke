"8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether "
"in tort (including \n"
"    negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law "
"(such as deliberate\n"
"    and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any "
"Contributor be liable to You\n"
"    for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or "
"consequential damages \n"
"    of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use "
"or inability to use \n"
"    the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, "
"work stoppage, \n"
"    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages "
"or losses), even\n"
